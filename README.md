# PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ Wildfire Impact Map

An interactive web application for visualizing and analyzing the health impacts of wildfire smoke PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ pollution across the contiguous United States. This project provides comprehensive data on PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ levels, excess mortality, years of life lost (YLL), and demographic factors from 2006-2023.

## üåü Project Overview

This interface was developed by an undergraduate intern at Princeton University's High Meadows Environmental Institute (HMEI) with the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (CPREE). The project aims to support air quality management and public health research by providing accessible, interactive visualizations of wildfire smoke impacts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map Visualization
- **County-level choropleth maps** showing PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ concentrations and health impacts
- **Multiple data layers**: Average, maximum, and population-weighted PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ data
- **Time controls**: Yearly, monthly, and seasonal data views (2006-2023)
- **Dynamic legends** with color-coded scales and units (¬µg/m¬≥)

### üìä Health Impact Analysis
- **Excess mortality estimates** by county and age group
- **Years of Life Lost (YLL)** calculations
- **Baseline mortality rates** from CDC Wonder data

### üîç Data Exploration Tools
- **County information panels** with detailed statistics
- **Bar charts** for temporal trends and decomposition analysis
- **Interactive hover effects** with real-time data display
- **Multi-metric comparisons** (fire vs. non-fire PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ)

### üìà Advanced Analytics
- **Concentration-Response Functions** from peer-reviewed research
- **Statistical models** including GEMM and Binned Poisson approaches
- **Decomposition analysis** for understanding contributing factors
- **EPA exceedance tracking** (2021-2023 averages vs. standards)

### üì• Data Downloads
- **PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ data** in CSV format with time period selection
- **Excess mortality data** with demographic breakdowns
- **YLL calculations** by county and age group
- **Filtered exports** by selected time periods and metrics

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with Material-UI components
- **Maplibre GL JS** for interactive mapping
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile devices
- **Component-based architecture** for maintainability

### Backend
- **FastAPI** (Python) for high-performance API
- **PostgreSQL** with PostGIS for geospatial data
- **SQLAlchemy** ORM for database operations
- **GeoPandas** for spatial data processing

### Data Sources
- **PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ Data**: Surface monitors, satellite observations, model simulations
- **Population Data**: US Census API (ACS 5-year and 1-year estimates)
- **Health Data**: CDC Wonder, peer-reviewed epidemiological studies
- **Geographic Data**: US Census Bureau shapefiles (2018)

## üìä Data & Methodology

### PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ Estimation
- **Combined approach** integrating multiple data sources
- **Fire attribution** using concentration-response functions
- **Quality control** and validation procedures

### Health Impact Calculations
- **Excess mortality** using Burnett et al.,  Ma et al., Qiu et al. CRFs
- **Years of Life Lost** with age-specific life expectancy data
- **Demographic analysis** for health equity assessment

### Research Foundation
This interface is part of ongoing research on improving wildfire smoke PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ estimates to support US air quality management. The methodology incorporates peer-reviewed research from leading institutions and follows EPA guidelines for air quality assessment.
